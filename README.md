# 🐾 Woofie: Assistive Ball Launcher and Treat System for Dogs  
### 🥈 Runner-Up – Most Innovative Design (UC Berkeley ME Mechatronics 2025)

**Woofie** is an interactive, multi-subsystem mechatronic device designed to empower pet owners—especially those with limited mobility—by automating a fetch-and-reward experience for dogs. Developed in UC Berkeley’s ME 102B Capstone, the system integrates ball launching, treat dispensing, and responsive feedback into a fully functional product.

## 🧠 Highlights
- Dual-motor launcher with **adjustable speed** control via potentiometer
- IR-triggered **dual treat dispensers** using rotary encoders and motor control
- **Interactive LCD display** for user feedback and real-time RPM display
- **Asynchronous audio playback** via piezo buzzer (Imperial March 🎵)
- **Two-state system control** (IDLE, ARMED) with auto-disarm logic
